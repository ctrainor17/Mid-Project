    "text": "In 2019, The Washington Post performed a study on the pay gap of employees at the post and addressed that their study shows that a pay gap does indeed exist across different genders and races. You can read more about the article here .\nSome visualizations made by the Washington Post included making a bar graph that represents the number of the employees based on their race. the study explored races, White, Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, Two or more races as shown in figure 1 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Employment Visualization Based on Race\n\n\nNonetheless, this visualization could be improved by showcasing the correlation between the gender an race and how they affect the pay of the respective employees.\n\n\n\nTo improve this visualization, we first examined the employment of employees based on their race using a line graph. This comparison showed us that there is indeed a difference in employment rates based on the race of the employees. We can see that the highest increase in number of employees was the number of white employees., thereby suggesting a preference in hiring salaried white employees when compared to other races such as Hispanic or Latino employees. On the other hand, the different categories of employment presented highlighted black employees have the highest hourly employment rate when compared to employees with other races as shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of Employment Type Across Different Races\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we compared the number of employees hired by the Washington Post based on their race and gender. First, we calculated the percentages of male and female employees in each race. Then, we utilized a stacked bar graph to represent the difference in employment rates based on both factors, gender and race. We can see that gender has a big impact on employment rates as shown in Figure 3. Furthermore, male employees are show to be in favor when compared to the females hired as the study showed that 98.1% of males with two or more races were shown to be male employees, followed by the Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and Black categories closely. On the other hand, it was clear to see that there is a higher percentage of White female women employees when compared to the White male employees hired by the post. Therefore, there is a huge difference in employment rates based on the gender and race.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Visualization of Employment Rate Based on Gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this project, we explored how to enhance visualizations by choosing which variables to work with. For instance, we created a line graph instead of the bar graph provided by the original study to examine the difference in employment rates by the Washington Post. The line graph in this case is a better choice of visualization as it showcases the different categories of employment (hourly and salaried) and clarifies the comparison between the total number of employees across different races. Moreover, a stacked bar was a good visualization choice to examine the difference in employment rates as it showcases the different numbers of employees within each race of employees in the Post Office."
