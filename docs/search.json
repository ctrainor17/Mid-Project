    "text": "In 2019 the New York Times published an article titled “Inside Football’s Campaign to Save the Game.” The article examined the sport’s culture and focused on the growing number of injuries among young players and the long term effects of these injuries. You can read the full article here.\nPictured below is one of the figures used to compare the number of injuries sustained by high school boys in six popular sports: football, hockey, wrestling, lacrosse, soccer, and basketball.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure offers an interesting comparison of the relative number of injuries, but without reading the numbers it is difficult to quickly compare the sports.\n\n\n\nFirst, we compared the total number of injuries sustained during competition in each sport. The numbers of injuries are reported as injuries per 10,000 competition plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the above graphic, the total number of recorded football injuries was over twice the number of any other sport in the surveyed population.\n\n\n\nNext, let’s take a look at the number of injuries sustained by type, or by what body part was injured.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootball leads nearly all of the injury categories in the surveyed population. The figure below allows you to more easily compare the injury categories by sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe statistic that is most troubling to researchers and parents alike is the significant number of head injuries sustained by high school boys playing football. Head injuries are particularly dangerous for developing brains and, increasingly, head injuries have been linked to mental illness in teenage boys."
